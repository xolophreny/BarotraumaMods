Enhances the vanilla Distiller decorative piece with the ability to synthesize Ethanol and Moonshine!
Additionally, allows processing Yeast Shrooms into Ethanol more efficiently.

Lua is not strictly required, but ensures that Distillers are interactable without having to edit submarines and outposts.

More recipes are planned, however there needs to be a better way to put them in place.
Currently, I have to completely override Ethanol for the recipes, which is most likely horrible for mod compatibility.
